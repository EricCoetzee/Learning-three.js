# Learning Three.js

Welcome to my repository where I explore and document my journey learning Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics on the web. Here, you'll find examples, notes, and projects that showcase the capabilities of Three.js and the skills I've developed.

## Introduction

Three.js makes it possible to render 3D graphics in a web browser using WebGL. The library provides an easy-to-use API to create complex 3D graphics that are interactive and beautifully rendered. My goal is to understand the core principles of 3D visualization and become proficient in using Three.js for web development.

## Project Setup

To get started with these projects, you will need Node.js installed on your computer to serve the files locally. Here's how you can set up your environment:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/EricCoetzee/Learning-three.js.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd learning-threejs
cd canvas

# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install --save-dev vite 

# Run a local server (you can use any server you prefer)
npx vite
